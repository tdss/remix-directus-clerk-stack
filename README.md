## Quickstart

Follow this [tutorial](https://codedgeekery.com/blog/directed-stack) to get started with the Directed Stack, there's a more in-depth step by step guide coming shortly.


Click this button to create a [Gitpod](https://gitpod.io) workspace with the project set up, Postgres started, and Fly pre-installed

## Development

This repo contains two folders plus the root:

- `directus`: our Directus headless CMS
- `scripts`: our Directus schema
- `/`: our Remix app

## First run

On first one, clone this repo and run:

```bash
yarn
yarn setup
```

Then go into the directus folder and set up for local development by copying your `.env.example` into `.env` and filling out the fields.

Then run:

```bash
npx directus bootstrap
```

## Markdown 

We use [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/) to render our markdown.

This lets us do syntax highlighting as well as adding other components, one example component is `callouts`

```markdown
{% callout title="You should know!" %}
This is what a note message looks like. You might want to include inline code in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a link in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}

{% callout type="warning" title="Oh no! Something bad happened!" %}
This is what a disclaimer message looks like. You might want to include inline code in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a link in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}


{% callout type="success" title="Oh no! Something good happened!" %}
This is what a success message looks like. You might want to include inline code in it. Or maybe you’ll want to include a link in it. I don’t think we should get too carried away with other scenarios like lists or tables — that would be silly.
{% /callout %}
```

## Deploying

### Railway

This app uses a [slugs](https://github.com/dimitrov-adrian/directus-extension-wpslug-interface) extension that you want pre-installed, you can use my [Directus Railway](https://github.com/freekrai/directus-railway) repo to get started on Railway, to deploy Directus to railway, click:

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/new/template/_dszdt?referralCode=codedgeekery)

You can find more info on this repo [here](https://codedgeekery.com/blog/directus-railway).

### Fly.io

If you're prefer to install Directus on [Fly.io](http://fly.io), you can follow this [repo](https://github.com/freekrai/directus-fly) instead.

### Directus Cloud

Directus also gives a terrific option of hosting via their [cloud service](https://directus.cloud), but you can’t use extensions on the free tier so the included schema would need to be changed so that the slug field is just a text field instead. 


### Migrate Schema

Once deployed, save `.env.example` to `.env`, and save the required info then run the following to to create the necessary collections:

```bash
cd scripts
node schema.mjs
```

### Users & Permissions

We also need to create a `users` user role, which has permissions to:

- notes
   - create: all access
   - view: where `created By` equals `$CURRENT_USER`
   - edit: where `created By` equals `$CURRENT_USER`
   - remove: where `created By` equals `$CURRENT_USER`
- users:
   - view: all access, Directus handles the proper rules
   - edit: where `ID` equals `$CURRENT_USER`

On the same page, there are checkboxes for app and admin, uncheck both of these if they are checked as this role will be through the api only. 

Take note of this role's ID as you'll need it when you deploy the remix app

As for images, one recommended approach is to create a folder inside files called `public` or `posts`, make note of the ID then go into roles & permissions, edit the `public` role, 

- directus_files
  - view: where `Folder` equals `ID` of folder you created
     - Then select just the ID field
  
This way, only images inside the `posts` or `public` folder is available publicly.

_If you don't want to deal with folders, then you can make all `directus_files` publically viewable, the choice is yours._

### Deploying the Remix app to Vercel

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Ffreekrai%2Fdirected-stack&env=SESSION_SECRET,DIRECTUS_URL,DIRECTUS_STATIC_TOKEN,DIRECTUS_USER_ROLE)
